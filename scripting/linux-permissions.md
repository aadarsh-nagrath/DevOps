# Comprehensive Linux Permissions & Commonly Used Linux Commands in DevOps

Linux permissions and command-line utilities are fundamental in managing systems, especially for DevOps tasks. Below are detailed notes on common Linux permissions and essential commands frequently used in development and operations.

---

## **1. Basic Linux Permissions**

### `chmod 775`
The `chmod 775` command is used to modify file or directory permissions. It grants **read**, **write**, and **execute** permissions to the **owner** and **group**, and **read** and **execute** permissions to **others**.

#### **Detailed Breakdown**
- `7` (Owner): **Read** (4) + **Write** (2) + **Execute** (1) = **7** (full access)
- `7` (Group): **Read** (4) + **Write** (2) + **Execute** (1) = **7** (full access)
- `5` (Others): **Read** (4) + **Execute** (1) = **5** (limited access)

### **Command Syntax**:
```bash
chmod 775 <filename or directory>
```

#### **Example**:
To set `775` permissions on `example.sh`:
```bash
chmod 775 example.sh
```

#### **Effect**:
- **Owner**: Read, write, and execute.
- **Group**: Read, write, and execute.
- **Others**: Read and execute, but **no write** access.

### **Verify Permissions**:
Use `ls -l` to check file permissions:
```bash
ls -l example.sh
```
Output:
```
-rwxrwxr-x 1 user group 1234 Jan 24 10:00 example.sh
```
- **`rwx` (Owner)**: Full permissions.
- **`rwx` (Group)**: Full permissions.
- **`r-x` (Others)**: Limited permissions (read and execute).

## **2. Understanding Linux File Permissions**

### Permission Types:
1. **Read (`r`)**: Allows reading of the file.
2. **Write (`w`)**: Allows modification of the file.
3. **Execute (`x`)**: Allows running the file (if itâ€™s executable).

### Owner, Group, and Others:
- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: Users in the same group as the file's owner.
- **Others**: All other users not part of the file's owner or group.

---

## **3. `chown` (Change Owner)**
The `chown` command changes the ownership of a file or directory.

### Syntax:
```bash
chown <user>:<group> <filename or directory>
```

### Example:
To change the ownership of `example.sh` to user `alice` and group `devs`:
```bash
chown alice:devs example.sh
```

---

## **4. `chgrp` (Change Group)**
The `chgrp` command changes the group of a file or directory.

### Syntax:
```bash
chgrp <group> <filename or directory>
```

### Example:
To change the group of `example.sh` to `devs`:
```bash
chgrp devs example.sh
```

---

## **5. Special Permissions: SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit**

### **SUID (Set User ID)**
- Applies to executable files.
- When a user runs an executable with SUID, the program runs with the permissions of the file's owner.
- Example: If a file with SUID set is owned by `root`, it runs with `root` permissions.

**Set SUID**:
```bash
chmod u+s <filename>
```

### **SGID (Set Group ID)**
- Works similarly to SUID but applies to group permissions.
- When applied to a directory, files created within that directory inherit the group of the directory rather than the user's current group.

**Set SGID**:
```bash
chmod g+s <filename or directory>
```

### **Sticky Bit**
- Applied to directories, ensuring that only the file's owner, the directory's owner, or `root` can delete files within the directory.
- Commonly used for shared directories like `/tmp`.

**Set Sticky Bit**:
```bash
chmod +t <directory>
```

## **6. Commonly Used Linux Commands for DevOps**

### **a. `ls` (List Files)**
- Lists files and directories in the current directory.

**Example**:
```bash
ls -l
```
Shows detailed file information (permissions, owner, group, size, timestamp).

### **b. `ps` (Process Status)**
- Lists running processes.

**Example**:
```bash
ps aux
```
Shows all running processes.

### **c. `top` (Real-time System Monitor)**
- Displays system processes in real-time, along with CPU and memory usage.

**Example**:
```bash
top
```

### **d. `grep` (Search Text in Files)**
- Used to search for text patterns within files.

**Example**:
```bash
grep "search_term" filename
```

### **e. `kill` (Terminate Process)**
- Sends a signal to terminate a process.

**Example**:
```bash
kill <PID>
```

### **f. `tar` (Archive Files)**
- Used to create compressed archives of files or directories.

**Example**:
```bash
tar -czvf archive.tar.gz /path/to/directory
```

### **g. `find` (Search Files)**
- Finds files based on various criteria.

**Example**:
```bash
find /path/to/search -name "*.txt"
```

### **h. `df` (Disk Space Usage)**
- Displays disk space usage for file systems.

**Example**:
```bash
df -h
```

## **7. Linux Networking Commands**

### **a. `ifconfig`**
- Displays or configures network interfaces.

**Example**:
```bash
ifconfig
```

### **b. `ping`**
- Sends ICMP Echo Request packets to a network host.

**Example**:
```bash
ping google.com
```

### **c. `netstat` (Network Statistics)**
- Displays network connections, routing tables, and network interface statistics.

**Example**:
```bash
netstat -tuln
```

### **d. `curl` (Transfer Data)**
- Transfers data from or to a server using various protocols (HTTP, FTP, etc.).

**Example**:
```bash
curl http://example.com
```

---

## **8. Disk Management and Partitioning**

### **a. `fdisk`**
- Used for managing disk partitions.

**Example**:
```bash
fdisk /dev/sda
```

### **b. `mount` and `umount`**
- Mounts or unmounts a file system to a specific directory.

**Example**:
```bash
mount /dev/sda1 /mnt
umount /mnt
```

---

## **9. Working with Logs**

### **a. `tail`**
- Displays the last few lines of a file, often used with log files.

**Example**:
```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

### **b. `journalctl` (Systemd Logs)**
- Used for querying logs from the systemd journal.

**Example**:
```bash
journalctl -u nginx
```

## **10. Managing Services in Linux (Systemd)**

### **a. `systemctl` (Manage System Services)**

- **Start a service**:
  ```bash
  systemctl start <service-name>
  ```

- **Stop a service**:
  ```bash
  systemctl stop <service-name>
  ```

- **Check service status**:
  ```bash
  systemctl status <service-name>
  ```

- **Enable service to start at boot**:
  ```bash
  systemctl enable <service-name>
  ```

- **Disable service from starting at boot**:
  ```bash
  systemctl disable <service-name>
  ```

## **11. Using Package Managers**

### **a. `apt` (Debian/Ubuntu)**
- Install a package:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install <package-name>
  ```

- Update package list:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  ```

### **b. `yum` (CentOS/RHEL)**

  ```bash
  sudo yum install <package-name>
  ```

- Update package list:
  ```bash
  sudo yum update
  ```
