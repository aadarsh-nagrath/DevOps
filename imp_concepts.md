### **1. Continuous Integration (CI)**
- Automating code integration into a shared repository multiple times a day.
- Tools: Jenkins, CircleCI, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.
- Key Benefit: Detects and fixes bugs early in the development lifecycle.

---

### **2. Continuous Delivery (CD)**
- Automating the release of validated code to a staging or production environment.
- Focuses on keeping code in a deployable state.
- Tools: AWS CodePipeline, ArgoCD, Spinnaker.

---

### **3. Continuous Deployment**
- Automates the process of deploying every code change that passes tests into production.
- Removes manual intervention for deployments.
- Tools: Kubernetes, Jenkins, Octopus Deploy.

---

### **4. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
- Managing and provisioning infrastructure through machine-readable files.
- Enables repeatable deployments and disaster recovery.
- Tools: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Ansible.

---

### **5. Configuration Management**
- Automating configuration and system management across infrastructure.
- Ensures consistency across environments.
- Tools: Ansible, Chef, Puppet, SaltStack.

---

### **6. Containerization**
- Encapsulating applications and their dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.
- Tools: Docker, Podman.

---

### **7. Orchestration**
- Automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containers.
- Tools: Kubernetes, Docker Swarm.

---

### **8. Monitoring and Logging**
- Observing system health, performance, and failures.
- Centralized logging for debugging.
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Datadog.

---

### **9. Version Control Systems**
- Tracking changes to code and enabling team collaboration.
- Tools: Git, SVN.

---

### **10. Microservices Architecture**
- Building applications as a collection of loosely coupled services.
- Benefits: Scalability, faster deployments, and fault isolation.

---

### **11. Blue-Green Deployment**
- Creating two identical environments (Blue - current production, Green - staging) to switch between them with zero downtime.

---

### **12. Canary Deployment**
- Gradually rolling out changes to a small subset of users before full deployment.

---

### **13. Observability**
- Gaining insights into a system's internal states through:
  - **Metrics**: Numerical values (e.g., CPU usage).
  - **Logs**: Events in the system.
  - **Traces**: Path of a request through a system.

---

### **14. Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)**
- Integrating security practices into the DevOps pipeline.
- Tools: Snyk, Aqua Security, HashiCorp Vault.

---

### **15. Cloud Computing**
- Leveraging cloud platforms for scalable and flexible infrastructure.
- Tools: AWS, Azure, Google Cloud.

---

### **16. CI/CD Pipelines**
- Automating the lifecycle of code: Build → Test → Release → Deploy.
- Tools: Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.

---

### **17. Feedback Loops**
- Shortening the time between writing code and receiving feedback (e.g., test results, user feedback).

---

### **18. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)**
- Combining software engineering with IT operations to improve system reliability and scalability.
- Key Metrics: Service Level Indicators (SLIs), Service Level Objectives (SLOs).

---

### **19. Feature Flags**
- Enabling or disabling features dynamically without redeploying code.
- Tools: LaunchDarkly, Split.io.

---

### **20. Chaos Engineering**
- Intentionally injecting failures to test the system's resilience.
- Tools: Chaos Monkey, LitmusChaos.

---

### **21. Load Balancing**
- Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability.
- Tools: NGINX, HAProxy, AWS Elastic Load Balancer.

---

### **22. Service Mesh**
- Managing communication between microservices securely and efficiently.
- Tools: Istio, Linkerd.

---

### **23. Rate Limiting and Throttling**
- Preventing overuse of system resources by controlling traffic.

---

### **24. Scaling**
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more instances.
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing resources in a single instance.

---

### **25. Backup and Disaster Recovery**
- Ensuring data integrity and availability during failures.
- Tools: Velero, AWS Backup.
