# Knative Notes

## Introduction  
Knative is an open-source platform that extends Kubernetes to enable serverless workloads and simplify the development, deployment, and management of cloud-native applications. It was developed by engineers from IBM, Google, and other leading industry contributors. Knative provides developers with tools and abstractions that make it easier to build, deploy, and manage serverless applications in Kubernetes.  

### Key Features of Knative  
- **Serverless Workloads**: Allows applications to scale dynamically, including scaling to zero when idle.  
- **Cloud-Native Capabilities**: Simplifies development and deployment processes, making Kubernetes feel more natural for developers.  
- **Extensibility**: Integrates with CI/CD pipelines, event-driven systems, and Kubernetes-native tools.

## Knative Architecture and Components  

Knative is built on three key primitives, which are the foundational building blocks:  

1. **Build**  
2. **Serve**  
3. **Eventing**  

### 1. Build  
The **Build** component simplifies the process of building container images directly within a Kubernetes cluster.  

#### Workflow:  
1. **Source Code**: The developer writes code and pushes it to a repository (e.g., GitHub).  
2. **Build Process**:  
   - Converts source code into a container image.  
   - Simplifies custom or complex build pipelines using Kubernetes-native tools.  
   - Supports reusable templates (e.g., Cloud Foundry Buildpacks).  
3. **Container Image**: The build system produces the final image and stores it in a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub).  
4. **Deployment**: The container image is deployed to Kubernetes using a single manifest file.  

#### Advantages of Knative Build:  
- **Cluster-Native**: Brings the entire build process into the Kubernetes environment.  
- **Simplified Workflow**: Reduces multi-step processes into a single YAML manifest.  
- **Customizable Builds**: Supports custom build logic with reusable templates.

### 2. Serve  
The **Serve** component focuses on deploying and managing services in Kubernetes with advanced traffic and scaling capabilities.  

#### Key Features:  
- **Traffic Management**: Built-in support for Istio enables advanced routing capabilities, such as A/B testing and blue-green deployments.  
- **Automatic Scaling**: Automatically scales applications from zero to many instances based on traffic.  
- **Revisions**:  
  - Every code deployment creates a new revision.  
  - Revisions are immutable snapshots of the service's configuration and code.  
  - Traffic can be distributed across revisions for staged rollouts or testing.  

#### Example Workflow:  
1. **Service Definition**: Define a service in Knative.  
2. **Revision Management**: Push updates to the service, creating new revisions.  
3. **Traffic Routing**:  
   - Use Istio to route a percentage of traffic to different revisions.  
   - Example: 10% traffic to a new revision for testing, 90% to the stable version.

### 3. Eventing  
The **Eventing** component allows developers to create event-driven applications by defining triggers and event flows.  

#### Key Concepts:  
- **Event Sources**: Define where events originate (e.g., HTTP requests, cloud services, or custom sources).  
- **Triggers**: Define conditions under which specific actions are invoked.  
- **Event-Driven Workflows**: Respond dynamically to real-time events.  

#### Use Cases:  
- **Serverless Automation**: Trigger actions in response to real-world events, such as weather changes or system alerts.  
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automate deployments and traffic rollouts when new code is pushed to the repository.  
- **Event Pipelines**: Chain multiple event-based actions for complex workflows.  

#### Example:  
- A delivery rerouting algorithm is triggered whenever inclement weather is detected.  
- Automate canary deployments where 10% of traffic is routed to a new version upon a push to the master branch.

## Knative's Key Benefits  

### Scaling to Zero and Beyond  
- Knative's autoscaling capabilities allow services to scale from zero pods (when idle) to thousands of pods (under high demand).  
- Efficient resource utilization: You only pay for what you use.  

### Developer Productivity  
- Reduces complexity by abstracting the repetitive steps involved in building, deploying, and managing applications on Kubernetes.  
- Allows developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure setup.  

### Flexibility and Extensibility  
- Works with existing CI/CD systems like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.  
- Supports multiple languages and frameworks.

## Additional Insights  

### Knative vs. Other Serverless Platforms  
- Unlike proprietary serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda), Knative is open source and runs on Kubernetes, giving developers full control.  
- Offers flexibility to integrate with any Kubernetes cluster, on-premises or cloud-based.  

### Community and Ecosystem  
- Knative is supported by major cloud providers and a growing open-source community.  
- Integrates with tools like Istio, Tekton, and Prometheus.

## Key Terminology  
- **Revisions**: Immutable versions of a service or function.  
- **Routes**: Manage how traffic is directed to different revisions.  
- **Buildpacks**: Templates for building container images from source code.  
- **Triggers**: Define conditions for executing serverless workflows.
